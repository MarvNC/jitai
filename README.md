List of 新字体/旧字体 and 標準字体/許容字体 in comparison to each other.

**Notes:**

Due to the nature of the 新字体 "simplification" it's really hard to make a proper list. Previous characters have been combined, re-purposed, gutted, only halfway simplified,... For this reason a lot of kanjis do not have a 1-1 旧字体 equivalent. Trying to reverse the changes would be near of an impossible tasks as the changes run too deep and are intertwined. On top of this the unicode han unification added further complexity by combining the proper form of characters with the "simplified" character. This means that two characters live within a single unicode block. The only way to access to both forms would be to use two different fonts with one being purposely built to only display 旧字体(e.g.:https://metasta.github.io/). To top it all, any kanji outside the (needlessly small) 当用(常用) list is not officially aprroved. To overcome this issue we have the propagation of 混ぜ書き(writing only one of the two kanji and the rest in kana when a word contains both 常用 and non-常用 kanjis), 代用字(replacement of a non-常用 character by a 常用 character that looks or sounds similar, loosing any connection to the etymology and meaning) and 拡張新字体 where the same kind of simplification is (non-officially) applied to non-常用 kanjis.
